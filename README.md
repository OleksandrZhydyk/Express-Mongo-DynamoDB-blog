# Express-Mongo-DynamoDB-blog

In this app was implemented architecture patterns like Repository and Data Transfer Object.
This approach allows to untie data layer from the other app parts and become our app independent from data layer implementation.

For example, there were integrated repositories for MongoDB and DynamoDB, for demonstrating possibility to switch between DB via one change.
